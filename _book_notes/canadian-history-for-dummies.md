Lookup more info on these isolated languages:

"The Pacific Northwest was the most densely populated area of Canada.
It has been estimated that almost *half* of Canada's total native population was living in British Columbia at the time of first contact.
More than 30 languages were spoken here, making it one of the most linguistically diverse areas anywhere on earth.
And two of the languages (Haida and Tlingit) are isolates:
unique and unrelated to any others."---
