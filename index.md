## Tait Hoyem

I am a student at the <a href="https://sait.ca/">Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT)</a>.

I have three goals in my software development career.

1. Strong adherance to the [UNIX principles](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html) of software design.
2. Security, privacy, and anonymity of the internet.
3. The accessibility of this technology to the visually impaired.

Some of my projects reflect these goals.
Others are just fun along the way.

I have all of my code projects hosted on [my Github](https://github.com/TTWNO).

### Projects

**[epub-with-pinyin](https://github.com/TTWNO/epub-with-pinyin)** ---
I wrote a program to add Pinyin above Chinese characters in .epub files to assist myself and others learning Mandarin Chinese.

**[chess](https://github.com/TTWNO/chess)** ---
I wrote a command-line chess game in C++. It is compileable on almost any system.

**[tait.tech](https://github.com/TTWNO/tait.tech)** ---
All the code for my website is open source.

**[lamegames.tait.tech](https://lamegames.tait.tech)** ---
A little games website I made for some demonstrations of Django functionality.
Very, very lame. Would not recommend.

**[subnetting](https://github.com/TTWNO/subnetting)** ---
A one-night write of a tool to automatically calculate network subnet masks based on required hosts and base IP.

I also occasionally put content on my [lbry channel](https://lbry.tv/@tait:7), and the [blog I host on this site](/blog/).
