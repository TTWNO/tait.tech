Structs are a way of grouping related data together.
Think of a struct the same way your would any other noun.
They often have many individual attributes that combine to make that thing.
For example, a student may have a first name, last name, student ID, GPA, list of classes, etc.
In this tutorial I use a very trimmed down version of what a structure generally contains to make the point without overwhelming you.

Hopefully it helps. Let me know about any improvements.
