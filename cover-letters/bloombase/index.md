## Tait Hoyem

Hello,

I am a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT),
in Calgary, Alberta
where I am taking a general IT diploma with a software development major.

The simple way of explaining my relationship with security is that it is *exactly* what I want to be doing with my career.
When given a chance to talk about anything I wanted related to technology, I chose to talk about Edward Snowden.
When given a chance to talk about any emerging trend in technology, I spoke about public-key encryption and the emerging Curve25519 eliptic curve crytographic method.

##### Security and privacy drive how I use computers.

I run Linux as my primary operating system. I use an offline password manager. My browser clears cookies every time I restart it.
These are all things that I do personally to protect myself.

It would be more motivating than ever to be responsible for the protection of somebody else's data.

Security is built right into my goals for my programming career. I have two goals:

1. Create ease of use for strong crytography, security and privacy tools.
2. Accessibility of software to the visually impaired.

These goals are intertwined in: "If you make something good, make it for everyone."

What I have to offer skill-wise is in my resume.

Thank you for your time; I hope I will be considered.

#### Location

I would also like to mention that although I currently live in Calgary, I would be willing to move to Vancouver for this position without compensation for the move.
