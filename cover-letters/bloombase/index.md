## Tait Hoyem

Hello,

My name is Tait Hoyem.
I am a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT),
in Calgary, Alberta
where I am taking a general IT diploma with a software development major.

The simple way of explaining my relationship with security is that it is *exactly* what I want to be doing with my career.
When given a chance to talk about anything I wanted related to technology, I chose to talk about Edward Snowden.
When given a chance to talk about any emerging trend in technology, I spoke about public-key encryption and the emerging Curve25519 eliptic curve cryptographic system.

My most intense interest is in operating systems internals and security.


Here is what I have to offer:

### Experience

I have reasonable experience with C++, C, Java and open-source scripting languages like Python.
I can link some projects I have built with each of those languages upon request.

I understand the low-level, bit-manipulating kind of code.
The kind of code that needs to be understood to implement and improve performance-critical code like encryption at-scale.

I run Linux as my primary operating system and manage many Debian server for websites I run for myself or independent clients.
My system administration experince is mostly on smaller systems.

### Certifications

I am willing to get all the certifications mentioned in the job description: CISM, CISSP and CISA while working with you.
