## Tait Hoyem

Hello,

I am a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT),
in Calgary, Alberta
where I am taking a general IT diploma with a software development major.

The simple way of explaining my relationship with security is that it is *exactly* what I want to be doing with my career.
When given a chance to talk about anything I wanted related to technology, I chose to talk about Edward Snowden.
When given a chance to talk about any emerging trend in technology, I spoke about public-key encryption and the emerging Curve25519 eliptic curve crytographic method.

##### Security and privacy drive how I use computers.

I run Linux as my primary operating system. I use an offline password manager. My browser clears cookies every time I restart it.
These are all things that I do personally to protect myself.

It would be more motivating than ever to be responsible for the protection of somebody else's data.

What I have to offer is in my resume.

I hope that I will be considered.

#### Location

I would like to mention that although I currently live in Calgary, I would be willing to move to Vancouver for this position without compensation for the move.
