I am a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT),
in Calgary, Alberta
where I am taking a general IT diploma with a software development major.

The simple way of explaining my relationship with security is that it is *exactly* what I want to be doing with my career.
When given an assignment to chose any technology related topic,
I chose to talk about Edward Snowden;
for an emerging trend topic, I delved into public-key encryption and the Curve25519 eliptic crytographic method.

I run Linux as my primary operating system, and I use an offline password manager. My browser clears cookies every time I restart it.
These are some basic things I do personally to protect myself.

I think everybody has things they should be keeping secure,
and I am very motivated to help them achieve the messure of security needed.

Security is build right into my goals for my programming career. I have two goals:

1. Create ease of use for strong crytography, security and privacy tools.
2. Accessibility of software to the visually impaired.

These goals are intertwined in: "If you make something good, make it for everyone."

I've included my resume for your review, and would like to note that I would be pleased to relocate to Vancouver for this position.

Thank you for your time in considering me for this position!

Sincerely,

Tait Hoyem
