* Unit - Machine-Level Programming
* Lecture 13 – Assembly language – Program Control – cmovX
* Iterative Statements – Loops

## Last Lecture

* In C, we can change the execution flow of a program
  1. Conditionaly
    * Conditional statements: if/else, switch
    * Iterative statements: loops
  2. Unconditionally
    * Functions calls
* In x86-64 assembly, we can also change the execution flow of a program
  * cmp\* instruction (compare)
  * jX insturction (jump)
  * call and ret instructions

## Today’s Menu

* Introduction
  * C program -> assembly code -> machine level code

## Homework: `int max(int x, int y)`


In C:

```
int max(int x,int y){
  int result = x;
  if(y>x)
    result=y;
  return result;
}
```

version 1 – with jX instruction

In Assembly: # x in %edi, y in %esi, result in %eax

```
max:
  movl %edi,%eax #result=x
  cmpl %edi,%esi #if y<=x then
  jle endif #return
  movl %esi,%eax #result=y
endif:
  ret
```

We branch (jump) when the condition (y > x) is false, i.e., when (y <= x)
-> This technique is called “coding the false condition first”
or ”taking care of …”

## Conditional move instruction cmovX

What C code looks like when using conditional operator:

```
result=test?val2:val1;
return result;
```

What logic of assembly
code looks like when using
cmovX (expressed in C):

```
result=val1;
if (test) result = val2;
return result;
```

Example: `cmovle Src,Dest`

Alternative: `int abs(int x)`

In C:

```
int abs(int x){
  if(x<0)
    x=-x;
  return x;
}
```

in assembly: # `x` in `%edi`, `result` in `%eax`

```
abs:
  movl %edi,%eax # result = x
  negl %edi # x = -x
  cmpl $0,%eax # if x < 0 then
  cmovl %edi,%eax # result = -x
  ret
```

## Advantage of conditional move cmovX

Note about branching:

* Branches are very disruptive to instruction flow through
microprocessor CPU pipelines
* However, since conditional moves (cmovX) do not
require control transfer (no branching/jumping required),
they are less disruptive
* So, `gcc` tries to use them, but only when safe

## What do we mean by “safe”?

* In `result = test ? aVal : anotherVal;` both values
(`aVal` and `anotherVal`) are computed so their
computation must be “safe”
* Example of unsafe computations:
  1. Expensive computations `val = Test(x) ? Hard1(x) : Hard2(x);`
    * Only makes sense when computations are very simple
  2. Risky computations `val = p ? *p : 0;`
    * Only makes sense when computations do not crash the application
  3. Computations with side effects `val = x > 0 ? x*=7 : x+=3;`
    * Only makes sense when computations do not have side effects

## Homework: Example: alternate `int max(int x, int y)`

version 2 – with cmovX instruction

In C:

```
int max(int x, int y){
  int result = x;
  if(y>x)
    result = y;
  return result;
}
```

In Assembly: # x in %edi, y in %esi, result in %eax

```
max:
  movl %edi,%eax #result=x
  cmpl %edi,%esi #if y>x then
  cmovg %esi,%eax #result=y
  ret
```

## While loop – “coding the false condition first” (updated)

`int x` and `int y` are arguments to function

in C:

```
while(x<y){
  //stmts
}
return;
```

Steps:

1. Analyze the condition: `x<y`
2. write `cmpl %esi,%edi`
3. List all outcomes:
  * $$x-y > 0 \implies x>y$$: exits loop
  * $$x-y < 0 \implies x< y$$: loops
  * $$x-y = 0 \implies x=y$$: exits loop
4. Which outcomes "exit loop"?
5. Write for false condition i.e. g & e (`jge`)

in assembly:

```
loop: # x in %edi, y in %esi
  cmpl %esi,%edi # cmpl y,x
  jge endloop
  #stmts in loop
  jmp loop
endloop:
  ret
```

Loop Pattern 1

```
loop:
  if cond false
    goto done:
  stmts
  goto loop:
done:
```

## While loop – “jump-to-middle” (updated)

`int x` and `int y` are arguments to function

in C:

```
while(x<y){ //step 1
  //stmts
}
return;
```

Steps:

1. (shown in C code)
2. (shwon in assembly)
3. All possible values
  * $$x-y >0 \implies x>y$$: exits loop, g
  * $$x-y < 0 \implies x< y$$: loops, l
  * $$x-y = 0 \implies x=y$$: exits loops, e
4. Consider outcome ???(can't read) "loops"

in assembly:

```
  jmp test
loop:
  # stmts
test:
  cmpl %esi,%edi #cmpl y,x (step 2)
  jl loop (step 5)
  ret
```

Loop Pattern 2

```
  goto test:
loop:
  # stmts
test:
  if cond true
    goto loop:
done:
```

## Do While loop – “jump-to-middle” (updated)

`int x` and `int y` are arguments to function

in C:

```
do{
  stmts
} while(x<y);
return;
```

in assembly:

```
loop:
  #stmts
test:
  jmpl %esi,%edi
  jl loop
  ret
```

Loop Pattern 2:

```
(deleted) goto test:
loop:
  stmts
test:
  if cond true
    goto loop:
done:
```

## For loop (updated)

In C:

```
//format: for(initialization; condition testing; increment)
for(int i=0;i<n;++i){
  //stmts
}
return;
```

Becomes:

```
i=0; // initialization
while(i<n){// condition testing
  //stmts
  i++; //increment
}
return;
```

Questions:

1. Here are we coding the false condition first?
2. Which loop patterns are we using?

Which becomes, in Assembly:

```
  xorl %ecx, %ecx # initialization
loop:             # %ecx (i) <- 0
  cmpl %edi, %ecx # while i < n true (testing)
  jge endloop     # jump when i>=n (false condition); In this situation "je" would also work. Do you see why?
  #stmts
  incl %ecx       # i++ increment
  jmp loop        # loop again
endloop:
  ret
```

## Summary

Compiler can produce different instruction combinations when assembling the same C code.

`cmp*` and `test*` instructions set condition codes

* In x86-64 assembly, there are no conditional statements, however,
we can alter the execution flow of a program by using …
  * `cmp*` instruction (compare)
  * `jX` instructions (jump)
  * `call` and ret instructions
  * `cmovX` instructions -> conditional move
* In x86-64 assembly, there are no iterative statements, however, we
can alter the execution flow of a program by using …
  * `cmp*` instruction
  * `jX` instructions (jump)
* CPU uses these condition codes to decide whether a …
  * `jX` instruction (conditional jump) is to be exectued or a
  * `cmovX` instruction (conditional move) is to be exectued
* 2 loop patterns:
  * “coding the false condition first” -> `while` loops (hence `for` loops)
  * “jump-in-middle” -> `while`, `do-while` (hence for loops)
