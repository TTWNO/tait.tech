# CMPT 295: Unit - Machine-Level Programming

* Lecture 8 – Introduction
* Compilation process: C -> assembly code -> machine level code

# Last Lecture
* Most fractional decimal numbers cannot be exactly encoded using IEEE floating point representation -> rounding
* Denormalized values
  * Condition: exp = 0000…0
  * 0 <= denormalized values < 1, equidistant because all have same 2E
* Special values
  * Condition: exp = 1111…1
    * Case 1: $$\text{frac} = \text{000...0} = \infty$$
    * Case 2: $$\text{frac} \neq \text{000...0} = \text{NaN}$$
* Impact on C
  * Conversion/casting, rounding
  * Arithmetic operators:
    * Behaviour not the same as for real arithmetic => violates associativity

## Today’s Menu

## What could these 32 bits represent?

What kind of information could they encode?

Answer:

* Aside from characters, integers or floating point numbers, etc…
* Review: We saw that all modern computers, designed based on the von Neumann architecture, store their programs in memory
  * Data and instructions of our C program are in main memory together (but in different locations)
* So, these bits could represent code, for example:
  * Assembly code: `sub $0x18, %rsp`
  * Machine code: `48 83 ec 18`

## C program in memory?

We have just spent a few lectures looking at how our data
can be represented as a series of 0’s and I’s, now …

1. Question: How does our C program end up being represented as a series of 0’s and 1’s (i.e., as machine code)?
2. Question: Then, how does our C program (once it is represented as a series of 0’s and 1’s) end up being stored in
memory?
3. Question: Then, how does our C program (once it is represented as a series of 0’s and 1’s and it is stored in memory) end up being executed by the microprocessor (CPU)?

## Demo – C program: sum_store.c

1. Question: How does our C program end up being represented as a series of 0’s and 1’s (i.e., as machine code)?

Let’s answer these questions with a demo


## Turning C into machine code - gcc

The Big Picture (transcriber's note: each step depends on the last; this is implied in the diagram):

* C program (.c) -> sum_store.c
  * C Preprocessor: `gcc -E sum_store.c > sum_store.i`
* Pre-processed Source (.i) -> sum_store.i
  * C Compiler
    * `gcc -Og -S sum_store.i`, or
    * `gcc -Og -S sum_store.c`
* Assembly Program (.s) -> sum_store.s
  * Assumbler: `gcc -g -c main.s sum_sotre.s`
* Object (.o) -> sum_store.o
  * Linker: `gcc -o ss main.o sum_store.o`
* Executable -> `ss`
  * Loader: `./ss 5 6`.
  * Disassemlber: `objdumb -d ss` (gdb/ddd debugger). This will write a disassembled object file which is the only one which is a mix between plain text and data.
* ISA - Instruction Set Architecture
* Computer Executes It
  * CPU
  * Memory

## Snapshot of compiled code

* C code: `*dest = sum;`
  * Store sum in memory designated by pointer dest
* Assembly code: `movq %rax, (%rbx)`
  * Move an 8-byte value to memory
    * Quad words in x86-64 parlance
  * Operands:
    * `sum`: register `%rax`
    * `dest`: register `%rbx`
    * `*dest`: memory `M[%rbx]`
* Machine code (1's and 0's): `0x40059e: 48 89 03`
  * 3-byte instruction
  * `48` stored at address `0x40059e`
  * `89` stored at address `0x40059f`
  * `03` stored at address `0x4005a0`

## Fetch-Execute Cycle

Terms:

<dl>
  <dt>PC - program counter</dt>
  <dd>Defn: register containing address of instruction of ss that is currently executing</dd>
  <dt>IR - instruction register</dt>
  <dd>Defn: register containing copy of instruction of ss that is currently executing</dd>
</dl>

Question: How does our C program (once it is represented as a series of 0’s and 1’s and it is stored in memory) end up being executed by the microprocessor (CPU)?

Answer: The microprocessor executes the machine code version of our C program by executing the following simple loop:

DO FOREVER:

* **fetch** next instruction from memory into CPU
* **update** the program counter
* **decode** the instruction
* **execute** the instruction

## Summary

* Review: von Neumann architecture
  * Data and code are both stored in memory during program execution

1. Question: How does our C program end up being represented as a series of 0’s and 1’s (i.e., as machine code)?
  * Compiler: C program -> assembly code -> machine level code
  * gcc: 1) C preprocessor, 2) C compiler, 3) assembler, 4) linker
2. Question: How does our C program (once it is represented as a series of 0’s and 1’s) end up being stored in memory?
  * When C program is executed (e.g. from our demo: ./ss 5 6 )
3. Question: How does our C program (once it is represented as a series of 0’s and 1’s and it is stored in memory) end up being executed by the microprocessor (CPU)?
  * CPU executes C program by looping through the fetch-execute cycle
