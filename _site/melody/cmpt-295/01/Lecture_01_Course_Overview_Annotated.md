# Welcome to CMPT 295
## Introduction to Computer Systems

My name is Anne Lavergne

Lecture 1 – Course Overview + Activity

<aside>How does it feel to be back on campus?</aside>

## Today’s Menu [1]

* COVID Protocol
* What is CMPT 295?
  * What shall we learn in CMPT 295?
  * What should we already know?
  * Which resources do we have to help us learn all this?
* Activity
* Questions

## COVID protocol – About masks! [2]
Here is a message from Elizabeth Elle, SFU Vice Provost Learning & Teaching, based on the public health order:

* Unless we have an approved exemption, we are required to wear a mask in all indoor common and learning spaces, including classrooms. Please come to campus prepared with a non-medical mask.
  * If we forget our mask, disposable masks are available from Student Central in Burnaby and at the information desks in Vancouver and Surrey.
  * If we require a mask exemption in the classroom for medical reasons, please contact the Centre for Accessible Learning at cal_admin@sfu.ca for assistance.
  * If we are requesting mask exemptions on other protected grounds, such as religion, we can contact the Office of Student Support, Rights and Responsibilities at student_support@sfu.ca.
* And please remember to be kind to each other. If we see someone not wearing a mask, do not make assumptions or judgments as that person may be exempt.

## What is CMPT 295? [3]

* The goal of this course is to give us, software developers, a look “under the hood” of a computer, i.e., to learn about Computer Systems => microprocessor, memory, … <img src="" alt="a car with its hood up.">
* This knowledge will allow us to become more efficient software developers

## The big picture: [4]

In CMPT 295, we shall learn …

* C programs (.c) -- How our code and data are represented in memory
* Assembly programs (.s) -- How a compiler transforms our code into machine executable code in several steps
* Object (.o) file an executable -- How a compiler optimizes (or not) our code
* Computer executes it -- How a microprocessor is designed and how it executes our code
* CPU, Memory -- How memory is designed

How all of this can impact the execution of our code How to write more efficient and reliable code:
* Be able to find and eliminate bugs
more efficiently
* Be able to ascertain program performance and tune it by optimizing our code

## What should we already know? [5]

* Write correct C programs
  * C constructs (variables, data types, pointers, if/else, switch/case, for/while/do while, function calls, arrays, …)
* What a stack is and how it works
* Binary/decimal/hexadecimal numeral systems
  * How to convert from one numeral system to the others
  * Basic arithmetic
* Perform Boolean algebra using and, or, not, xor

## Which resources do we have? [6]
