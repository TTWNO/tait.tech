<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I am a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT),
in Calgary, Alberta
where I am taking a general IT diploma with a software development major.</p>

<p>The simple way of explaining my relationship with security is that it is <em>exactly</em> what I want to be doing with my career.
When given a chance to talk about anything I wanted related to technology, I chose to talk about Edward Snowden.
When given a chance to talk about any emerging trend in technology, I spoke about public-key encryption and the emerging Curve25519 eliptic curve crytographic method.</p>

<h5 id="security-and-privacy-drive-how-i-use-computers">Security and privacy drive how I use computers.</h5>

<p>I run Linux as my primary operating system. I use an offline password manager. My browser clears cookies every time I restart it.
These are all things that I do personally to protect myself.</p>

<p>It would be more motivating than ever to be responsible for the protection of somebody elseâ€™s data.</p>

<p>What I have to offer is in my resume.</p>

<p>I hope that I will be considered.</p>

<h4 id="location">Location</h4>

<p>I would like to mention that although I currently live in Calgary, I would be willing to move to Vancouver for this position without compensation for the move.</p>
