To: Bloombase

128 W Hastings St #350
Vancouver, British Columbia
V6B 1G8, Canada

Job Number: 620145
</pre>

<p>I am a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT),
in Calgary, Alberta
where I am taking a general IT diploma with a software development major.</p>

<p>The simple way of explaining my relationship with security is that it is <em>exactly</em> what I want to be doing with my career.
When given an assignment to chose any technology related topic,
I chose to talk about Edward Snowden;
for an emerging trend topic, I delved into public-key encryption and the Curve25519 eliptic crytographic method.</p>

<p>I run Linux as my primary operating system, and I use an offline password manager. My browser clears cookies every time I restart it.
These are some basic things I do personally to protect myself.</p>

<p>I think everybody has things they should be keeping secure,
and I am very motivated to help them achieve the messure of security needed.</p>

<p>Security is build right into my goals for my programming career. I have two goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create ease of use for strong crytography, security and privacy tools.</li>
  <li>Accessibility of software to the visually impaired.</li>
</ol>

<p>These goals are intertwined in: “If you make something good, make it for everyone.”</p>

<p>I’ve included my resume for your review, and would like to note that I would be pleased to relocate to Vancouver for this position.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time in considering me for this position!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Tait Hoyem</p>
