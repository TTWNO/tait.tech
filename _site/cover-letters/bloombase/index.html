<p>Hello,</p>

<p>My name is Tait Hoyem.
I am a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT),
in Calgary, Alberta
where I am taking a general IT diploma with a software development major.</p>

<p>The simple way of explaining my relationship with security is that it is <em>exactly</em> what I want to be doing with my career.
When given a chance to talk about anything I wanted related to technology, I chose to talk about Edward Snowden.
When given a chance to talk about any emerging trend in technology, I spoke about public-key encryption and the emerging Curve25519 eliptic curve cryptographic system.</p>

<p>My most intense interest is in operating systems internals and security.</p>

<p>Here is what I have to offer:</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>

<p>I have reasonable experience with C++, C, Java and open-source scripting languages like Python.
I can link some projects I have built with each of those languages upon request.</p>

<p>I understand the low-level, bit-manipulating kind of code.
The kind of code that needs to be understood to implement and improve performance-critical code like encryption at-scale.</p>

<p>I run Linux as my primary operating system and manage many Debian server for websites I run for myself or independent clients.
My system administration experince is mostly on smaller systems.</p>

<h3 id="certifications">Certifications</h3>

<p>I am willing to get all the certifications mentioned in the job description: CISM, CISSP and CISA while working with you.</p>
