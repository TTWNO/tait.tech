<h1 id="why-i-want-to-work-for-proton">Why I Want To Work For Proton</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>You may notice from the email address that I personally use a Protonmail email address. That in itself may not prove anything.
That said, security and privacy is what I live for.
Everybody deserves access to secure communication away from the prying eyes of the NSA, its global partners in spymenship and other governments and special interest groups around the world.</p>

<p>Proton embodies, to me, what email—and other internet services in general—<em>should</em> be. A service you pay for with your money, not your data.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-plan-to-achieve">What I Plan To Achieve</h2>

<p>My specialty is in improving accessibility with screen readers and other blind-friendly devices.
The recent addition of key bindings to navigate the interface will go a <em>long</em> way towards accessibility for the visually impaired.
Awesome work!</p>

<p>I want to help Protonmail be the best secure, accessible email platform in the world.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-applied-despite-lack-of-experience">Why I Applied Despite Lack Of Experience</h2>

<p>I have been writing websites since high-school; I went to collage to learn what ‘real’ software development is like. Despite this, I put more time and effort into my off-school hours to learn what people are actually using on a large scale: Django, Ruby On Rails, Redis, Docker, ES6 Javascript. None of which was taught in class.
Since leaving school I have had the opportunity to use everything I learned out of class in real-world scenarios and I trust that I can take this information to Proton where I can help make the software better for everyone.</p>

<p>I am a self-starter and a go-getter. Nothing proves it like how much I learned outside of my classes compared to inside.</p>

<hr />

<p>I would be honoured to work for a company I truly believe in.</p>

<p>—Tait Hoyem</p>
