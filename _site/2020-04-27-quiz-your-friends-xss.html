    <h1>The "Quiz Your Friends" XSS Exploit</h1>

<h2 id="how-i-found-this-exploit">How I Found This Exploit</h2>

<p>While filling in one of my friend’s surveys I thought it would be
funny for them to know it is me without anyone else knowing.
We were young and had <code class="highlighter-rouge">Inspect Element</code>ed a few things together,
so it was a safe bet that an HTML joke would let them know.</p>

<p>So I typed in my name like so:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">BOLD_STEVE.JPG</code></p>

<p>Now in theory this should have shown in in the leaderboard as: “&lt;b&gt;Bold Steve&lt;/b&gt;”
However, to my horror and excitement, I saw this in the leaderboard:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">BOLD_STEVE_LEADERBOARD.JPG</code></p>

<p>The text “Bold Steve” showed up <strong>in bold</strong> on the leaderboard.
This told me all I needed to know. To add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag was next.</p>

<h4 id="hacking">Hacking:</h4>

<p>So I went on my merry way thinking about ways to use malicious javascript.
Then, I thought that might be mean, so I decided to warn users instead.
I filled in the name with a script tag and a call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">alert()</code> to warn the user about this site.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">JAVASCRIPT_NAME.JPG</code></p>

<p>I ran out of room before I could finish it. Hmmm.
What if I do “Inspect Element” and manually override the max-length attribute?</p>

<p>The unfortunate truth is: this worked as well!</p>

<p>Not only could I manually set the max-length by changing it in the HTML,
but there were no client-side OR server-side checks to make sure the name I was sending was less than or equal to 20 characters.</p>

<p>If Javascript checked it, it would have stopped me (although maybe not a professional).
If the server checked it, it could have stopped almost anyone.</p>

<h5 id="server-side-validation">Server-Side Validation</h5>

<p>As a side note, here is a great reason why you should do most of your validation on the server side.
As a user, I can edit any of the HTML, CSS, or Javascript your server serves to me.</p>

<p>Imagine trying to fit in a script tag doing anything useful with 20 characters?</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script src="http:"&gt;</code></p>

<p>There’s your 20 characters! No more! Good luck trying to do anything useful with this!</p>

<p>The Quiz My Friends server has <em>no such checks in place</em>.
Therefore, I can send an almost arbitrary load to them.
Being able to send something potentially very large (more than a few megabytes) is a vulnerability of its own.
Imagine being able to send entire executable progrmas as your “name” in one of these quizes?</p>

<h2 id="executing-an-exploit">Executing An Exploit</h2>

<p>Suppose we’re on a vulnerable site like <a href="https://www.quizyourfriends.com/">Quiz Your Friends</a>
and you decide you want to hack your friend’s quiz!
How can this be done?</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-quiz">Creating A Quiz</h4>

<p>Here is my quiz below:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">CREATING_QUIZ.IMG</code></p>

<h4 id="setting-a-name-with-an-html-tag">Setting A Name With an HTML Tag</h4>

<p>Just like the image above, about how I found out about this vulnerability: go ahead and use an HTML tag in your name to test this out.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">BOLD_ITALIC_STEVE.JPG</code></p>
