<div class="article">
  <p>I found a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
in a well-known quiz hosting website.
I disclosed the vulnerability to them years ago, so I thought
now might be a good time to write about it.</p>

<p>In this first article I will explain what XSS is.</p>

<p>In the next article I will explain how I found this attack.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-cross-site-scripting-xss">What is cross-site scripting (XSS)</h2>

<p>Cross-site scripting, XSS for short,
is a technique to execute arbitrary Javascript code on a user visiting a website
by linking to Javascript code stored on another server.</p>

<p>So for example:</p>

<p>I have a file on my website called <a href="/assets/js/hacked.js">hacked.js</a>.
If I was able to run this javascript file on anybody visiting a certain website <em>that is not mine</em>, this would be called cross-site scripting.</p>

<p>Click the above <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hacked.js</code> link to view the code I use to “hack” this website.
It’s safe, I promise ;)</p>

<p>Now, how can we get this code to execute when a user visits this site?
To explain, I will start with some of the underlying technologies.</p>

<h3 id="escape-characters">Escape Characters!</h3>

<p>No, this is not a Sherlock Holmes novel!</p>

<p>If we suppose that a website is built with sequences like these (called “tags”):
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;p&gt;</code> (for paragraph), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;b&gt;</code> for bold,
then why can you <em>see</em> the left and right angle bracket characters?
Don’t they mean something? Shouldn’t they be telling the browser:
<em>“Hey! Make me bold!”?</em>
Why <em>doesn’t</em> everything after me typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;b&gt;</code> turn bold?</p>

<p>The answer is:</p>

<p>There are special characters in HTML to type a visible left (&lt;)
and visible right angle bracket (&gt;) in a website.
If I use the left and right brackets on my keyboard however,
things will indeed <b>show up bold</b>.</p>

<p>This is the code for the sentence I wrote above:</p>
<pre class="terminal">
There are special characters in HTML to type a visible left (&amp;lt;)
and visible right angle bracket (&amp;gt;) in a website.
If I use the left and right brackets on my keyboard however,
things will indeed &lt;b&gt;show up bold&lt;/b&gt;.
</pre>

<p>Notice how all visible left angle brackets use an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;lt;</code> to show them?</p>

<p>These are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character">escape characters</a>.
They tell a system, in this case your web browser:
<em>“Hello! Please show me off! I don’t want to be hidden.”</em></p>

<h4 id="sanitization">Sanitization</h4>

<p>Most of the time XSS attacks are done using poorly sanitized HTML <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<p>Sanitization is when a program (usually on the server side),
will remove characters like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code> and replace them with the aforementioned “escape characters”.
Internally this would be something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;lt;</code>,
but they would show up to a user as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>When inputs are not properly sanitized <em>and</em> the input is shown to the user in another part of the website,
then a malicous user can type in HTML that will run whenever anybody tries to look at what they typed.
For example: a name for a quiz website (input) and the leaderboard for said quiz (display).</p>

<p>HTML, by itself is not very dangerous.
The worst thing you could do is probably put a link on your name,
and then point it to a porn site.
Make your name bold, italic. Maybe make the background a funny color.
Although this may annoy your victim it is not dangerous security wise.</p>

<p>There is one tag however, that <em>is</em> scary…</p>

<h2 id="script"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code></h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag allows you to write code that can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change the page contents.</li>
  <li>Redirect the user to a new page automatically.</li>
  <li>Get a user’s location.</li>
  <li>Open a user’s microphone/webcam.</li>
  <li>With the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_attributes.asp">attribute</a> you can also load a script from another site. (This is XSS)</li>
</ol>

<p>Those last two will ask for permission from the user (if their browser isn’t insanely insecure).</p>

<p>In my next article I’ll talk about a website I found which is vulnerable to this attack.
And, show you how you can run your own XSS attack.</p>
