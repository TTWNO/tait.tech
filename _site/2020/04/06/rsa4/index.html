It should be noted that in some circles the tools used are more common than in others. These are the everyday tools of many privacy advocates and computer nerds.</p> <p>If you have never used Linux however, then the method of doing this will be rather unfamiliar. This tutorial will be done on an <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> machine, but it should be the same on Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, MacOSX, etc. The only operating system that does not include these tools by default (or easily accessible) is Windows.</p> <p>This tutorial makes heavy use of the terminal. You have been warned.</p> <p><em>Let us…begin!</em></p> <h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding#ASCII_armor"><strong>ASCII armour</strong></a> — A way to encode <strong>OpenPGP</strong> documents so they are readable by humans. These files end in .asc</li> <li><strong>(Open)PGP</strong> — An open standard for encoding pulbic keys and encrypted documents.</li> <li><strong>GPG</strong> — GNUPrivacyGaurd is an implementation of <strong>OpenPGP</strong>. It is installed by default on most Linux distrobutions.</li> </ul> <h2 id="step-0-setup">Step 0: Setup</h2> <p>We will be using the utility <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg</code> for this tutorial.</p> <p>The other thing to note: The character ‘$’ (dollar sign) is usually not typed when shown in a command. It simply indicates that you do not need administrative privilages to run these commands.</p> <p>Test to see if you get this output in your terminal.</p> <pre class="terminal">

Maybe this is a friend, a journalist, or a whistleblower.</p> <p>To encrypt a document with somebody’s public key, you need to first obtain it. My public key is available <a href="/public-key.asc">at this link</a>, and you can use it to send me encrypted stuff.</p> <p>If you are on a linux terminal, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> command to download it.</p> <p>wget:</p> <pre class="terminal">
$ wget https://tait.tech/public-key.asc
</pre> <p>Curl:</p> <pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://tait.tech/public-key.asc -o public-key.asc
</pre> <h3 id="make-your-own-optional">Make Your Own (optional)</h3> <p>The following section is quite long, so if you don’t want to create your own keypair, then feel free to skip to <a href="#step-2-import-public-key">Step #2</a>.</p> <p>If you want to encrypt your own documents, or you want others to be able to send you encrypted messages, then you can create your own public/private key pair. You can use these to encrypt your documents, and you can send our public key to others so that they can securely communicate with yourself.</p> <p>Run the following command in your terminal, and follow the steps I outline to get you started.</p> <pre class="terminal">
$ gpg --full-gen-key
</pre> <p>This will produce the following dialog:</p> <pre class="terminal">

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 
</pre> <p>Type the number 2048.</p> <p>Next it will ask you how long you want the key to be valid.</p> <pre class="terminal">
Requested keysize is 2048 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.

Is this correct? (y/N) 
</pre> <p>Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> to confirm your choice.</p> <p>Now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg</code> is going to ask you to create a user id to indetify this key. Use some test data for now.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? <b>O</b>
</pre> <p>It will then ask you for a password. If you are simply using this for test purposes, then you can feel free to set it to something like “test”. When create a long-term use pulbic key make sure to make the password <em>very</em> secure.</p> <p>During the process of creating your key, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg</code> may warn you with this message:</p> <pre class="terminal">
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

</pre> <h2 id="step-2-import-public-key">Step 2: Import Public Key</h2> <p>This list of keys that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg</code> keeps on tap so to speak, is called our “keyring”. Your will need to import a new public key to encrypt files with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg</code>.</p> <p>If you already created your own public key, then this step is not necessary unless you want to also encrypt something for me :)</p> <figure> <img src="/assets/img/keyring.jpg" alt="A keyring holding eight allen keys."/> <figcaption> A keyring holding eight allen keys. </figcaption> </figure> <p>To import a public key to use for encrypting files, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--import</code> option of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg</code>. Like so:</p> <pre class="terminal">
$ gpg --import public-key.asc
gpg: key 64FB4E386953BEAD: public key "Tait Hoyem &lt;tait.hoyem@protonmail.com&gt;" imported

</pre> <p>Now that we have imported a public key, we can make a message to send!</p> <h2 id="step-3-have-a-message-to-encrypt">Step 3: Have A Message To Encrypt</h2> <p>You can make a new file which holds some important, secret data. Feel free to use a graphical editor if you have one, if not, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> works alright too.</p> <pre class="terminal">
  Rules Of A Good Life:

  1. Wash your hands!
  2. Work hard!
  3. Be firm.
  5. Have good friends!
</pre> <p>Save this file as something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test-pgp.txt</code>, and we’ll use that name later.</p> <h2 id="step-4-encrypt-a-message">Step 4: Encrypt A Message</h2> <p>Now that we have a message to send and person to send to, all we have to do is encrypt this message and it’ll be on its merry way! To do so, we must specify two new options to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg</code>.</p> <p>The first is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--recipient</code>. This tells <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg</code> to encrypt using a certin public key that we have in our keyring. You can use the person’s name, email address, or the key’s uid.</p> <p>The second is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--encrypt</code>.</p> <p>You will also specify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--armour</code> option to use ASCII armoured files. Put this option after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--encrypt</code>, and put the file name after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--armour</code>. See below.</p> <p>You can either use your own public key name to encrypt a document (allowng only you to decrypt it), or you can use my public key that we imported earlier (allowing only me to decrypt it). Either way works fine.</p> <p>This is the big one!</p> <pre class="terminal">
$ gpg --recipient "Tait Hoyem" --encrypt --armour test-gpg.txt
</pre> <p>“But there is no output!” you might say! Yes, that is because our new (encrypted) file has already been saved. Let’s look at it with cat.</p> <pre class="terminal">
