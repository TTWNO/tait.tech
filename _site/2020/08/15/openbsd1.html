For me, somebody that is intensely interested in security, there is one option: OpenBSD.</p> <p>Now, my interest in OpenBSD has been going on for a long time. I started poking around for Linux alternatives way back a few years ago when Linus Torvalds decided to leave after he got in trouble for some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/linus-torvalds-defends-his-right-to-shame-linux-kernel-developers/">unprofessional behaviour</a>. That said, Linus did come back to Linux development, but I knew that his abrasive style is what brought good code to the Linux kernel. I also knew that his ability to be critical would be hurt by the new <a href="https://itsfoss.com/linux-code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>. It would become a tool for the SJW types to hammer on Linus for being a “white male, et al.”; It would become a tool for the easily offended to use to get their dumb code into Linux; It would become a tool for the corporatization, the HR-ification of Linux. Frankly, this does not interest me.</p> <p>Now I’m sure that OpenBSD has its own internal policies that I disagree with. That said, Theo De Raadt is still at least known for calling Firefox an “amorphous peace of garbage” due to its lack of privilege separation. And, in their <a href="https://openbsd.org/goals.html">project goals</a> page, they specifically mention:</p> <blockquote> <p>Be as politics-free as possible; solutions should be decided on the basis of technical merit.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now that’s something I can get behind! Bet you that’s not in the Linux COC?</p> <p>He also went to university in my hometown, so that’s pretty cool! I can support a local madman who thinks he can make a better operating system than all those corporations. Maybe he was right, maybe not. What I know is I am excited to find out!</p> <p>Wish my luck on my OpenBSD journey. I will post updates here along the way.</p> <p>Happy hacking!</p> </div> </main> <hr> <footer> This page is mirrored on <a href="https://beta.tait.tech/2020/08/15/openbsd1.html">beta.tait.tech</a>. </footer> </div> </body> </html>
