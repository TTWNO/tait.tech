<h2 id="1-accessible-bios">1. Accessible BIOS</h2>

<p>Update:
See my blog post with the guy who’s writing the <a href="/2021/06/21/uefi-audio/">new audio driver into EDK2</a>.</p>

<p>Some server motherboards include serial UART/I<sup>2</sup>C ports which can be used to manage a BIOS via serial.
If this is possible, would it be able to attach to a braille display via an intermediary like a Rockchip/Pi SBC or Arduino compatible chip using <a href="https://brltty.app">BRLTTY</a> and serial input from the motherboard?
Maybe not as it <a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO/rhl-biosserial.html">appears to require</a> a full Unicode terminal, which I have the suspicion that BRLTTY will not be able to automatically filter out the formatting characters.</p>

<p>I found one paper referencing the (in)accessibility of BIOS, specifically UEFI BIOS from Brazil.
I have downloaded the paper and uploaded it here for reference.
<a href="/assets/pdf/bios-accessibility.pdf">PDF of “UEFI BIOS Accessibility for the Visually Impaired”</a>.</p>

<p>After emailing the authors of the paper, I found out that one of them, Rafael Machado, was able to get a song playing in UEFI as a part of his masters.
Here is a link to the Github <a href="https://github.com/RafaelRMachado/Msc_UefiHda_PreOs_Accessibility">Msc UEFI PreOS Accessibility</a>;
he has links to YouTube videos where he is shown playing a song on an ASUS laptop with PCIe connected speakers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2De9dI9WbwM">Song Playing in UEFI</a></p>

<p>I have downloaded and played around with his Github project but to no avail.
Either I am not setting it up correctly, or I do not have the proper sound setup, but in any case no sound plays from either my laptop or desktop.</p>

<p>This requires more research and investment to understand UEFI, HDA audio, what systems have it and how to work with words and other sounds.</p>

<h2 id="2-terminal-oriented-browser">2. Terminal-oriented browser</h2>

<p>Use selenium to allow a cross-engine compatible terminal-browser with JS support. Yes, sure, it has all the bloat of the modern web as it uses the full code of Chrome/Firefox/Webkit—but at least it can be used in the terminal.
Guaranteed to be accessible.</p>

<p>I’m thinking of similar key commands to Orca/NVDA but output is send to the terminal. Unsure of how to handle aria-live regions, but perhaps a queue could be used to print text. Unsure how to calculate delay as the user may be using a screen reader at different speeds and/or a braille display.</p>

<p>Change backend on-the-fly with a page reload. So if a website doesn’t work with Webkit, load it in Firefox with a key command.</p>

<p>Just an idea.</p>

<h2 id="3-3d-printing-of-google-mapsopenstreetmaps-data-for-the-visually-impaired">3. 3d printing of Google Maps/OpenStreetMaps data for the visually impaired.</h2>

<p>A larger project, to be sure, but one I think could be of interest.
Imagine being able to download some data from Google or OpenStrretMaps,
then put it into a program and have it generate a 3d map which can be printed.
Unsure what to do, as the braille overlay on top of the streets and important buildings, etc. needs to be of a uniform size (braille cannot be scaled) but the buildings, streets, and parks do need to be scaled in size.</p>

<p>I think for beginning, forget the braille entirely and simply product a map.
This can be done in the STL file format or some intermediary if that is easier.
Roads will have a slight border on the side,
parks will have a diamond texture,
buildings will have slight rectangular borders (slightly wider than the roads),
paths will be a thin line, and the label for the path will need to extend the thin line into a (rounded) rectangle with text on it.</p>

<p>Start with roads.
Get a road, get it to generate the correct shape.
Then add a border around the side.
Then, add 4 more roads and figure out how to intersect them.</p>

<p>If it can be done on a display, it can be done in a file.</p>

<p>Start with that. Wow what a daunting project!</p>

<p>This is being worked on through the <a href="https://github.com/skarkkai/touch-mapper">touch-mapper</a> project.
They do not, however, have labels yet.</p>
