<p>My name is Anne Lavergne</p>

<p>Lecture 1 – Course Overview + Activity</p>

<aside>How does it feel to be back on campus?</aside>

<h2 id="covid-protocol--about-masks-2">COVID protocol – About masks! [2]</h2>
<p>Here is a message from Elizabeth Elle, SFU Vice Provost Learning &amp; Teaching, based on the public health order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unless we have an approved exemption, we are required to wear a mask in all indoor common and learning spaces, including classrooms. Please come to campus prepared with a non-medical mask.
    <ul>
      <li>If we forget our mask, disposable masks are available from Student Central in Burnaby and at the information desks in Vancouver and Surrey.</li>
      <li>If we require a mask exemption in the classroom for medical reasons, please contact the Centre for Accessible Learning at cal_admin@sfu.ca for assistance.</li>
      <li>If we are requesting mask exemptions on other protected grounds, such as religion, we can contact the Office of Student Support, Rights and Responsibilities at student_support@sfu.ca.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>And please remember to be kind to each other. If we see someone not wearing a mask, do not make assumptions or judgments as that person may be exempt.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-cmpt-295-3">What is CMPT 295? [3]</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The goal of this course is to give us, software developers, a look “under the hood” of a computer, i.e., to learn about Computer Systems =&gt; microprocessor, memory, … <img src="" alt="a car with its hood up." /></li>
  <li>This knowledge will allow us to become more efficient software developers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-big-picture-4">The big picture: [4]</h2>

<p>In CMPT 295, we shall learn …</p>

<ul>
  <li>C programs (.c) – How our code and data are represented in memory</li>
  <li>Assembly programs (.s) – How a compiler transforms our code into machine executable code in several steps</li>
  <li>Object (.o) file an executable – How a compiler optimizes (or not) our code</li>
  <li>Computer executes it – How a microprocessor is designed and how it executes our code</li>
  <li>CPU, Memory – How memory is designed</li>
</ul>

<p>How all of this can impact the execution of our code How to write more efficient and reliable code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be able to find and eliminate bugs
more efficiently</li>
  <li>Be able to ascertain program performance and tune it by optimizing our code</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-should-we-already-know-5">What should we already know? [5]</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Write correct C programs
    <ul>
      <li>C constructs (variables, data types, pointers, if/else, switch/case, for/while/do while, function calls, arrays, …)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What a stack is and how it works</li>
  <li>Binary/decimal/hexadecimal numeral systems
    <ul>
      <li>How to convert from one numeral system to the others</li>
      <li>Basic arithmetic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Perform Boolean algebra using and, or, not, xor</li>
</ul>
