This is an announcement for a new project of mine:
[lamegames.tait.tech](https://lamegames.tait.tech).

This is something I'm really excited to work on!

Right now, I've just got a rock-paper-scissors game.
A chat function, and a few simple card games to come.

Check out the repository on my [Github](https://github.com/TTWNO/lamegames.io).
