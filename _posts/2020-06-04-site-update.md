I updated the site with some easier to identify information about me and my projects :)

Also, Clue has been delayed due to my partner in crime on the project wokring too many hours.

I also posted a new project called *[Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/TTWNO/caesar-cipher)* in C. It will be an intermediate example of how to use build systems like `make`.
