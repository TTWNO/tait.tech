Ooo! Exciting!
Today I want to announce a new project I'll be working on which should be live within the month of May:
Clue.

The original board game, implemented in an accessible format via the web.

It uses a Node.js backend and standard Javascript/HTML frontend.
Nothing fancy.

All the code will be hosted here: [https://github.com/TTWNO/clue](https://github.com/TTWNO/clue)

It will be licensed under the BSD-3 license, meaning it can be used for any reason---even commercially and without source-code disclosure---without prior authorization, but it *must* acknowledge that I helped build the end product.

Once the project is live, it will be located at: [Lame Games]() (currently a dead link).
