title: "rfi: A Simple Linux utility to get a random file from a directory"

I made a [little video](https://lbry.tv/@tait:7/rfi:5) about this script I wrote:

<pre class="terminal">
$ rfi
</pre>

This program gets a random file from your current directory
if you do not specify one;
it gets a random file from the specified directory if you give it one like so:

<pre class="terminal">
# rfi /etc/wireguard
</pre>

Which is very useful if you want to start a random VPN configuration :)

The code, comments, etc. are on the [Github](https://github.com/TTWNO/scripts).
