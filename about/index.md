### About

I am a student at the <a href="https://sait.ca/">Southern Alberta Insitute of Technology (SAIT)</a>.

My fascination lies primarily with operating system internals and systems-level tools.
My goal is to bring the everyday computing environment of Linux/BSD nerds to visually impaired users, and to ensure the saftey, privacy and security of the internet.
Some of my projects reflect this.

I have all of my code projects hosted on [my Github](https://github.com/TTWNO).

### Projects

**[epub-with-pinyin](https://github.com/TTWNO/epub-with-pinyin)** ---
I wrote a program to add Pinyin above Chinese characters in .epub files to assist myself and others learning Mandarin Chinese.

**[chess](https://github.com/TTWNO/chess)** ---
I wrote a command-line chess game in C++. It is compileable on almost any system.

**[tait.tech](https://github.com/TTWNO/tait.tech)** ---
All the code for my website is open source.

**[Napolean](https://github.com/TTWNO/Napolean)** ---
A work-in-progress suite of tools to be used in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi 
and camera to produce text files from scanned books.

**[subnetting](https://github.com/TTWNO/subnetting)** ---
A one-night write of a tool to automatically calculate network subnet masks based on required hosts and base IP.

I also ocassionally put content on my [lbry channel](https://lbry.tv/@tait:7), and the [blog I host on this site](/blog/).
