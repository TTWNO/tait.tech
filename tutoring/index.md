## Tutoring

I believe in solving problems.
Learn how to solve your own unique computer-related problems by learning how they work underneath all the fancy buttons you see.

My favourite resources are the following:

* [thenewboston (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston)
* [cppreference.com](https://cppreference.com) (also has C references)
